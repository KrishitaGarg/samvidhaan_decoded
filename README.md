# Samvidhaan Decoded

This README provides an overview of the project, including team details, relevant links, tech stack, key features steps to run the project locally and instructions on how OnDemand APIs are utilized in this project.

## Project Overview
Our website "Samvidhan Decoded" has a user-friendly platform that is designed to make legal information more accessible to larger parts of the population. 
The website offers simplified, layman-friendly verbatim of laws, institution-wise categorized, to place the understanding of complicated legal jargon in the hands of all sorts of people. The aim is to bridge the gap between the world of legal jargon and the everyday understanding-a way by which persons can now gain an insight into how the law functions practically. 
We have fitted in an AI-driven chatbot using the OnDemand.io platform to interact with and learn from the user directly and instantly to answer any queries about laws, provisions in the constitution, or about any institution. Accuracy and the depth of answer could be well provided through these bots in real-time, thus affording the users access they need over a topic in the shortest possible time span with maximum convenience. 
There are very interesting, intellectually provoking activities designed solely to make users more familiar with the Indian laws and the Constitution. These activities engage users in the material by applying their knowledge and, therefore, create a more interactive and rewarding learning experience. Our platform aims to be an indispensable resource for any individual who seeks to explore with greater detail the intricacies of Indian law and governance by providing easy-to-understand legal explanations and engaging interactive tools.

## OnDemand's APIs Utilization
We have leveraged the outstanding services of OnDemand.io across various areas, benefiting from their support with a wide range of tasks. 
Notably, their preconfigured RAG models and seamless integration of multiple RAG models tailored to our needs have been invaluable. 
When creating a custom RAG model for our specific data, the process required almost no effort, thanks to their streamlined setup. 
Additionally, we utilized their text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and language translation services to enhance our AI chatbot, making it both scalable and robust.
